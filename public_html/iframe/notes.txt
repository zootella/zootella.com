notes v7

Here are some notes in a text file.
The goal is to have the page read them into script.

That would be really awesome if it were somehow possible.

And, it seems to not be.
Works fine when on a server, but with file:/// you're getting this:

> f2.contentWindow.document
VM322:1 Uncaught DOMException: Blocked a frame with origin "null" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
    at <anonymous>:1:18

So that's too bad. :(
